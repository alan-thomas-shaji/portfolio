# 🛠️ The Scavenger's Path

**"The Scavenger's Path"** is a deeply immersive, Star Wars-themed personal portfolio. It serves as a digital workbench where code meets the cosmos, blending a gritty, industrial aesthetic with the high-tech elegance of the Jedi Order. Made it myself with design inspo, and some help from my ai collegues XD

## 🎨 Design & Aesthetic
* **The Workshop:** The interface is designed to feel like a top-down view of a technician’s workbench in the Outer Rim—complete with rusted metal panels, tactile toggle switches, and scattered mechanical parts.
* **The Cinematic Opening:** New visitors are greeted with the classic *"In a server far far away..."* blue-text crawl, followed by a high-speed hyperspace jump that reveals the workshop.
* **The Holopad:** The experience section transitions from the gritty reality of a workshop into a glowing, holographic blue interface where career milestones are unlocked.
* **Jedi Evolution:** Each career stage is represented by custom-themed visuals, from studying ancient scrolls to levitating complex systems with the Force.

## ⚔️ Built With
* **Astro:** For a lightning-fast, modern web architecture.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Powering a custom "Scrap Tech" and "Kyber Crystal" color palette.
* **Anime.js:** Driving the cinematic hyperspace transitions and radial starfield effects.
* **Custom SVGs:** Hand-crafted icons including Mandalorian helmets, lightsaber hilts, and hydro-spanners.
